Imagine this scenario: A lawyer uses ChatGPT to assist with legal research for a high-stakes case. It provides the research, which the lawyer includes in his official court documents. His confidence in the capabilities of AI and lack of time makes him skip proofreading the generated research. In the courtroom, the lawyer finds out that the citations and cases, along with the research presented by the AI, are completely fictitious. This leads to a bewildering situation in court, undermining his credibility and affecting the case outcome.

This story isn't just an imaginary tale; it is, in fact, what happened in a trial in the United States[^1]. As such, it's a reality we face as businesses and professionals increasingly depend on advanced AI language models without fully understanding their limitations. These tools, while sophisticated, can produce erroneous ‘hallucinated’ information that seems entirely genuine.

In this article, we will explore the abilities and challenges of current AI technologies and show how we can move towards more dependable systems. We will explore the details of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and fine-tuning, assisting you in determining the most suitable approach for your requirements. 

## How are LLMs Trained?

Think of LLMs as digital sponges, soaking up vast amounts of textual data from the internet and books. Through self-supervised learning[^2], they learn to predict missing words and understand the context of sentences. It's like solving a massive fill-in-the-blanks puzzle, training the models to understand and generate human-like language.

Large language models are trained on huge corpora of textual data. This has given the models revolutionary capabilities compared to their predecessors but has also introduced new challenges. For example, the latest model from Meta, **LLaMA 3**, was trained on over 15T tokens of data—7 times the training set of its predecessor, LLaMA 2.

## Challenges Faced by LLMs

General-purpose models like GPT-3.5 and LLaMA 3 are useful for various tasks. However, they come with challenges that can vary in severity based on the specific use case. These challenges include:

- **Limited access to up-to-date information**
- **Lack of expertise in specific domains**
- **Lack of factualness and accuracy**
- **Hallucinations**

You might not notice these issues if you ask ChatGPT to write you a bio in Star Wars Jedi style. However, if you ask it to help you answer law-related questions about the state of California, you might encounter laws that do not exist or references to cases that never happened.

## Generative AI Approaches

There are at least two core factors to consider when choosing a generative AI approach:

1. **External Data**: Does your use case require dependency on unique or private data not in the public domain?
2. **Capability & Domain Understanding**: Does the model lack the expertise or domain knowledge to perform the required tasks effectively?

### Decision Framework

Here’s a framework to guide your choice between RAG and fine-tuning:

- **RAG**: Use when external knowledge is needed for tasks such as real-time question answering.
- **Fine-tuning**: Use when domain expertise is required for tasks such as legal or medical document generation.
- **Combined (RAG + Fine-tuning)**: Use when both factors are critical to your use case.

## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

RAG is a technique that combines external information retrieval with text generation. Information is retrieved from external sources (e.g., databases or web content) and incorporated into the text generation process. This approach enhances the generated content by grounding it in real-time or domain-specific data, resulting in more accurate and contextually relevant responses.

### How RAG Works

RAG combines two components: 

1. **Retriever**: Acts like a smart librarian, scouring external knowledge sources to find relevant information.
2. **Generator**: Uses the retrieved knowledge to craft a well-informed response.

Here’s an example:
Imagine asking an AI assistant powered by RAG, "What are the key events that led to the American Revolution?" The retriever would scour its knowledge base, fetching relevant passages about the Boston Tea Party, the Stamp Act, and other historical events. The generator would then use this retrieved information to construct a factual and comprehensive answer.


## Fine-tuning for Domain or Task Adaptation

Fine-tuning adapts a pre-trained language model to excel in a specific domain or task. It involves personalized training sessions using task-specific data.

### Examples of Fine-tuning

1. **Task-Specific**: Expose the model to examples and labeled data relevant to the target task.
2. **Domain Adaptation**: Adapt the model to specific industries, like fine-tuning for legal, medical, or financial documents.
3. **Style Transfer**: Fine-tune the model to mimic a specific writing style, tone, or persona.

For example, a legal firm can fine-tune an LLM on a vast corpus of legal documents to generate error-free contracts and briefs.

## Choosing the Right Technique: RAG or Fine-tuning?

The choice depends on your specific needs and resources:

- **RAG**: Best for knowledge-intensive tasks like open-domain question answering or generating diverse content.
- **Fine-tuning**: Best for domain-specific tasks like medical dialogue systems or technical writing.
- **Combined Approach**: Fine-tune a RAG model to create an AI assistant that is knowledgeable and highly specialized.

## Conclusion

As we delve deeper into generative AI, methods such as RAG and fine-tuning are paving the way for new horizons. Advanced iterations of RAG-based systems and fine-tuning techniques (e.g., LORA) are instrumental in constructing compact yet potent models.

Whether you're an entrepreneur, researcher, or technologist, now is the perfect time to explore RAG and fine-tuning to unleash the full potential of generative AI.
